Context

In the early 2000s, Billy Beane and Paul DePodesta worked for the Oakland Athletics. While there, they literally changed the game of 
baseball. They didn't do it using a bat or glove, and they certainly didn't do it by throwing money at the issue; in fact, money was 
the issue. They didn't have enough of it, but they were still expected to keep up with teams that had much deeper pockets. This is 
where Statistics came riding down the hillside on a white horse to save the day. This data set contains some of the information that 
was available to Beane and DePodesta in the early 2000s, and it can be used to better understand their methods.
Content

This data set contains a set of variables that Beane and DePodesta focused heavily on. They determined that stats like on-base 
percentage (OBP) and slugging percentage (SLG) were very important when it came to scoring runs, however they were largely 
undervalued by most scouts at the time. This translated to a gold mine for Beane and DePodesta. Since these players weren't being 
looked at by other teams, they could recruit these players on a small budget. The variables are as follows:

    Team
    League
    Year
    Runs Scored (RS)
    Runs Allowed (RA)
    Wins (W)
    On-Base Percentage (OBP)
    Slugging Percentage (SLG)
    Batting Average (BA)
    Playoffs (binary)
    RankSeason
    RankPlayoffs
    Games Played (G)
    Opponent On-Base Percentage (OOBP)
    Opponent Slugging Percentage (OSLG)

Inspiration

It is such an important skill in today's world to be able to see the "truth" in a data set. That is what DePodesta was able to do with 
this data, and it unsettled the entire system of baseball recruitment. Beane and DePodesta defined their season goal as making it to 
playoffs. With that in mind, consider these questions:

    How does a team make the playoffs?
    How does a team win more games?
    How does a team score more runs?

They are all simple questions with simple answers, but now it is time to use the data to find the "truth" hidden in the numbers.
